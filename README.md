# reedos

You could say reed-oh-ESS, but we've been saying rEE-doss.

See [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in getting
involved.

### Notes

We currently support Rust's `GlobalAlloc` in order to use the `alloc` crate. We
do so by wrapping page allocation and finer grained virtual memory allocation
into a `Global Allocator` struct which implements Rust's `GlobalAlloc` trait. As
an example, this is valid `reedos` kernel code:

```rust
use alloc::collections;
{
    // Simple test. It works!
    let mut one = Box::new(5);

    // Slightly more interesting... it also works! Look at this with GDB
    // and watch for the zone headers + chunk headers indicating 'in use' and
    // 'chunk size'. Then watch the headers as these go out of scope.
    let mut one_vec: Box<collections::VecDeque<u32>> = Box::default();
    one_vec.push_back(555);
    one_vec.push_front(111);
}

{
    // Now, more than a page.
    let mut big: Box<[u64; 513]> = Box::new([0x8BADF00D; 513]);
}
```

## Setup

In order to get started with this project you'll need the following:

- Rust (currently on nightly branch)
- QEMU compiled for riscv
- `riscv-gnu-toolchain` (don't forget to add to PATH)
- `rustup target add riscv64gc-unkown-none-elf`

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed, you should be able
to get all of these by running `nix develop` (can be automatically loaded when
you enter the directory if you have direnv).

## Usage

Pretty much everything can be done through cargo now:
| Cargo | Make | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cargo build` | `make build` | build (output is `target/<ARCH>/<PROFILE>/reedos`) |
| `cargo run` | `make qemu` | build and run with QEMU |
| `DEBUG=1 cargo run` | `make qemu-gdb` | build and run with QEMU (wait for gdb) |
| `cargo doc --open` | `make docs` | build and open documentation in a browser |
| `cargo clean` | `make clean` | remove `target/` directory |

You can exit QEMU by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>, then <kbd>x</kbd>.

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>c</kbd> gives a console, but you will
  find `gdb` much more helpful.

### Debug tools

You may find the following debug tools (that you have mostly already installed) helpful:

- `riscv64-unknown-elf-{objdump, gdb}` ‚Üê Recommend viewing docs material on
  becoming a GDB power user.
- In QEMU with `-nographic`, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>, then
  <kbd>c</kbd> to get to the console, then run `help` to see available commands.

### Docs

- Use `make docs` or `cargo doc --open` to build and open the crate
  documentation in a browser.
- Make sure to read the documentation in `docs/` too!
